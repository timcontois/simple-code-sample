# simple-code-sample

How to run: clone this repository (or download sample.py directly) and run "python sample.py" in the command line.

Note: if python refers to python 2 on your machine, you'll want to run "python3 sample.py" instead.

This is an example coding question I used while interviewing candidates at my last company. 

Suppose you have 2 lists of numbers x and y. For example, x = [5, 0, 1000, 8] and y = [40, 7, 10, 80]. Write a method to find the minimum absolute difference between one number in x and one number in y. In the given example, the minimum absolute difference is 1 (from 8 in x and 7 in y).

I hoped candidates would at least get the naive solution going through the 2 lists checking every combination. I also hoped candidates would be able come up with a version with better performance for long lists.
